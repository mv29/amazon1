5,The king now.,Ishu Srivastava,"What can we expect in a RS. 35,000  device..??",8
5,Awesome!,Akash mandaL,"First of all my grievance is that i had ordered it on 10th of August and after 3days seller has shipped this order, may be it is because of sale. But the delivery boy is awesome and nice to talk with he suggested me to open the box in front of him and took video of that also. I have to say that the phone is very premium and nice to hold. Screen quality is just awesome but the battery life is not that great it is not bad but not as expected when you have AMOLED display but the charger that comes in a box is fabulous. Everything is great in this phone considering price. You can purchase this phone blindly.",8
5,Amazing phone,Abhijeet Panse,It's an amazing phone ..,6
5,A steal at 27k,KAUSHIK,All criterions are top notch on the device..the only thing to address is the camera.. although it is simply the best in it's range..I advice everyone to install the Gcam mod from XDA...the camera hardware is extremely capable and with the pixel camera..well it becomes a pixel 2xl with a snapdragon 845..also camera 2api is natively supported so download n u are ready to go.,4
5,One of the best decisions I made off late :),Saurabh,"Well, you know that feeling of awesomeness, when you get more than what you expect, this is what it is for me with this fantastic device.",3
5,Flagships can be cheap too.,Prashanth reddy,Been using this for almkst 5months now. Excellent phone with great screen and great camera. And talking about speed. Ahhh it is certainly got all the speed and agility you needed. Dash charge is so helpful. Mirror black version has a flaw that its black glass is finger print magnet. Protect your phone with a case all the time.,4
5,Oneplus = flagship killer,Dhiraj pidurkar,Their is no doubt why oneplus is now indias no 1 premium smartphone brand . I am in love with picture quality of this phone. shot taken in low light  is far better than any other flagship phone specially iphones expensive shit. Battery back up is good it gives me 5 to 6 hours of battery usage time altough if you play pubg the battery usage time limited to 3 to 4 hours but not a problem for me beacuse of dash charger,4
5,The beast yeh!,Jayaraj Vijayan,"Every aspect of this phone is great. There is no negative at least from my perspective. Camera is good, speed is the absolute best, screen is sharp and bright, reception is great and there is zero bloat, it just never slows down! I would highly recommend.",3

5,Premium quality Phone at a decent Price,Subhadeep Sengupta,"Premium smart phone experience, with a higher midrange price. 8 gb RAM, Very good camera quality. Oxygen OS is very much fluid. Near about stock android experience, with little bit extra functionalities. Superior SD845 chip provides butter Smoot mobile experience. Responsive face ID, though it doesn't works in dark environment. It's touch response little bit slow. It has single audio speker. No wireless charging. Though the back of the phone made of glass. Screen quality is  very good. Overall an very good product with a decent price point.",One

5,Very Good phone.,AKG,"I don't know much about the technical stuff. As a layman, I find this phone to be stylish enough, touch response/feel is great, photos are better than what I get on my wife's iPhone, haven't felt any lagging while using different applications, be it Outlook, be it candy crush, general browsing, YouTube, WhatsApp etc etc. Sound quality on calls is really good. Ease of using the Settings and understanding the UI is pretty cool. Going by the reviews, the brand equity of the product,, and my  personal experience using it, I feel the money I spent is totally worthwhile.",

5,It's Super fast!!!,Mr. Ali,Bought this phone about a month ago in just 27999 INR (with 1000 INR Amazon pay cash back) and this is my opinion after using it for a month:,
5,Premium phone bundled at a Mid Range Price!!!,Shoaib,"I was using Nexus 5x a Stock Android Phone. When i bought this, i was  bit sceptical  with regards to the Camera,Display and The Stock android experience. Even though it is not Stock Android, I am Very Comfortable with the UI on ONE PLUS. Moving on, the battery life is Amazing it gives me about 1 Complete day regular usage(Without Gaming), If i switch on the battery saver it gives me roughly more than 1 and half day for my usage. Camera is Good but not that great(as compared to high end devices like samsung s9 or note and even pixel 3xl) and the Display is quite Bright and can been used in daylight. The processor is quite fast with 6gb RAM. One plus 6 is just a premium phone bundled at a Mid Range Price!!!",
5,The Best Android Configuration in its Segment,Sushil,Bought this phone about a month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a month.,683
5,Totally Satisfied!!!,Danish Zargar,"After about 6 months of usage, I am finally ready to share my experience of using this device. Build quality is totally amazing. Camera is good and the processor (Snapdragon 845) is the best processor available in the market today. As always, Dash Charge technology of OnePlus is supremely fast and can provide a day's worth of charge in just 30 minutes (literally). Battery backup is awesome even if you are a heavy user and does not disappoint you at any point in time. Display quality is also excellent and does it's job perfectly.",
5,You just can't go wrong with this product,Varun,"After 3 days of use I liked a lot of things about this phone. Build is premium right from the first look and feel, dash charge is crazy fast, camera performance is amazing, oxygen os which is like near stock android, blazing speed and can handle multi tasking with ease, gaming experience is another level with this phone, handy gestures option and good call quality.  Couple of this I feel can be improved is low light face unlock and bigger battery. Overall an awesome experience.",2
5,Best Android smartphone out there,Rohit Joshi,Everything is already common knowledge about the device so I'll just add my personal experience. The device works seamlessly across apps and has no problem handling any heavy activity.,
5,Best SD845 Flagship Phone | Worth the price!,Yatish,"No doubt SD845 is a beast, and this phone nails it. It comes with near to stock android experience by oxygen OS which is OnePlus custom UI for years,",
5,"Pathetic Amazon, Amazing OnePlus",Prateek Jain,"Amazon delivery was outright bad for this. I had got an exchange deal with this, little did I know the delivery experience would be so horrible",One
5,Great Purchase - Totally satisfied,vijay,I was a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 user for 3 years before I switched to OnePlus 6. This is the most expensive phone I ever got and it was totally worth the amount I paid (INR 27999).,One
5,"If you are reading this and you have the required amount. BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET!",Rajshree Gupta,"This phone is definitely worth the price. Do not compare it with Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi. Belongs to a different class. Battery is immortal. I charge it in the morning, takes 30 mins or so to 100% and gives me a full day heavy usage with it. Though memory is low as of 64gb but then you can carry a 64/128 gigs of type c otg pen drive.",2
5,Even better than oneplus6t itself,Viral,"The slogan itself represents the phone ""the speed you need"" great camera great battery and the android pie with the oxygen os for smoother performance what else you need it looks premium as well to be honest i am happy that i bought oneplu6 and not oneplus6t because of headphone jack and the slow in display fingerprint sensor other than that all specs are similar so i am happy",One
5,Succesful mobile,lokesh,Yet another masterpiece from one plus. Been using from 6 months now. Handled it very rough. Installed many apps and games. Using it heavily and havent noticed little lag or any problem so ever. No lag. Does justice to the caption. Speed you need. Had issues with amazon delivery. My first order was lost in transit. Then reordered from prime now with 2 hour delivery. Now glad we have offline retail stores. Need not to rely on Amazon when they are irresponsible and lose the 30k item in transit.,
5,Is there an option to give 6 star Amazon?,Neha,It's Amazing!!! Best phone at a decent price. This is first 30k range mobile I am buying and I am in love with it.,One
5,After 5 months of use,Amazon Customer,"Really liked the phone. It is everything it claims to be. High end hardware for a medium price range (when compared with iPhone). Battery is good, no heavy draining. 1 hour charging keeps my phone alive till next morning. Iam not a heavy gamer or always screen-on type of user. I use my phone in my breaks and mostly after reaching home. Hardware is still running good after incremental updates. I really really like the face unlock which even doesn't let you see the lock screen. Amazingly fast. Midnight black is really good with all the glass on its back it feels like a high premium quality mobile like around 80k. Best buy  in the price range and also a little above its price range.",
5,Excellent Phone ...,Sunil Kumar Sharma,"It fulfill my utmost requirements which I expect with a smart phone. Phone is really too fact, unbelievable Face scanner, Work on VOLTE which connecting call & data really too fast, Camera pictures Quality also good, deep detailing observed. 3300 Mh batter but do not have any problem as discharging rate is very slow and charging with Desk Charger is very very Fast, only require 60 Minuts to 100 % Charging. Overall Satisfy our need.",
5,A very awesome deal if you consider it over the 6t,Ashutosh Jatkar,"Bought this one just before the relase of the 6t, so had a very good deal. Got the 256 GB variant for ‚Çπ35.5k which was very sweet.",
5,Overall great experience,Amazon Customer,"Really nice phone for the price. The quality is really amazing. Great to have an out of the box guard. The dash charger is amazing. I was initially pessimistic about the battery backup due to its on-paper capacity, but the practical backup coupled with the dash charging is literally the best. The camera is really precise. I'm not an expert but it's gives really sharp pictures, has lots of options and doesn't get heat up even after extended long periods of video shooting and casual gaming. The speaker is also great(it would be better if they weren't mono speakers though) . Honestly speaking, I moved up from Moto g4 plus to this device so everything feels much superior but it's definitely value for money",One
5,Oneplus 6 Long term review,Siddhartha,Likes,
5,The true flagship killer.,Sonak Saha,"Yes It's OnePlus 6. I waited for it after releasing the OnePlus 5T. I would honestly desired to purchase only OnePlus 6. The true flagship killer. Killer specifications with smoothly running. Lois awesome, camera outstanding, performance too good. Overall the golden product from OnePlus. Thanks OnePlus.",One
5,"Hands down, best thing I ever bought.",Muqtadir,"Battery life is better on oreo, wait till they roll out the next update and then update to pie. Fast charge is crazy, 20 mins charge and I'm done for the day at optimal use. I only get SSS in pubg now. The screen brightness is too good, the smooth browsing, gestures, camera (compared with iPhone X) everything 10/10. Can't imagine a better phone",2
5,"Class, Premium & Great Against Higher Priced Iphones",msukhsarwala,"I shifted from iphone X to oneplus 6, & yes definitely this is really good performing device with great specs. i am already in love with this phone. awesome built quality & i really love its time to time updates. I also use Huawei Mate 10 Pro which is having higher specs and great phone, but i wanted other phone with my budget against shifting from iphone to android & i opted for oneplus 6, but now my view for this phone is not just budget but a class apart against iphones.",
5,The True Flagship Killer.,Krish,"Worth all the hype around it, clicks nice pictures, UI is the best I have ever seen, I have used quick charge before but dash charge is something else. Comes with pre-installed tampered glass and a rubber case so u don't have to spend anymore money. There are 2 other options at this price range which are cheaper so is their buid quality, and none have amoled panels, It isn't called a flagship killer for no reason, this comeptes with flagship devices in both specs and built quality, so if you are looking for a phone to stick to for the next few years go for this phone.",
5,An alternative for expensive high end smartphones.,RUKMANGADAGOWDA C.,"Device is awesome with zero lag. Picture quality is at its best. Reading mode is awesome for Kindle app, News paper apps etc. Battery lasts for a day at least with 3-4 hours of display usage and all time 4G on. Overall device is good.",One
5,Why break your bank for a Galaxy Flagship when you have a beast for half the price,Deepak Nair,"This is my second Oneplus device after having used Oneplus 3 since the launch of the so called Flagship back then. Completely impressed with the dash charging back then in 2015, the only disadvantage i have ever felt in OP3 is battery life as it drains fast. That too is completely sorted in OP6 as i am getting more than a day in average usage and close to a full day with live streaming on mobile data and continous screen on time. Camera is a vast improvement which will definitely compete with the best. Guys just think about the price point here and you can easily forget any minor flaws. The only one which i think fares better than OP6 is Note 9. But again it cost 70k. Finally i got the red color which i longed for. Completely satisfied with the purchase. Giving 4 stars to the battery as i still wanted 3800 or 4000 mAH.",
5,Guaranteed value for money phone!,Dave,"This phone is really a masterpiece when it comes to speed and display quality. The screen is superb with excellent details. Sound quality is exactly what we like and what we want. The slider to change the mode to vibrate and silent is cool. Although the battery is good enough, but a heavy user might get a little disappointed with battery. My expectations with camera quality was also not met. The photo quality is good but when we zoom in, it does get blurry which I believe should not happen.",One
5,I love it- Simply awesome,Rahul R,"After using this product from last 5 month I have only one comment, it's amazing phone I gifted one plus 6t to my wife after using one plus 6 and whenever I replace my one plus 6 then I replace only with one plus series phone..",One
5,up o the mark!!!!!,Ravendra Singh,"the one plus 6 128gb is best phone and it comes with a back cover also.......although there is no one plus earphone or headphone with it that the company should have provided..........otherwise its one of the best phone ,maybe equal to iphone or better than that as its price is within reach...... the camera is incredible ,both rear and selfie.......portrait mode is like pics from dslr.......!!!!!! the phone comes with latest android version and is best to use  for heavy gaming app!!!!",One
5,Join team OnePlus!,Kailash,"The best phone I have ever had. The picture quality is awesome! Really fun to play with.  The processor is super fast, have never seen a lag in all the months I have used it. Compared to the last mobile I owned, this one is almost divine luxury! lol..",One

5,A product you can Shift to from conventional smartphone brands,Swapnil Jain,Bought this for my dad who was using Samsung S5 previously & was really frustrated with its battery backup and tendency to hang. I was skeptical about shifting him to this brand as he is very choosy about brands. But finally went for it after reading and viewing 100s of reviews and honestly after about 15 days of usage this hasn't disappointed on any front.,
5,Best phone,Vaibhav,Bought this phone about a 6month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a 6month.,
5,An Excellent product,Thaneshwar Sahu,"No phone can match the quality of One plus 6. You can find many other brand and even they offer same kind of processor but build quality, speed, no heat up , battery these are the issues that user face in the longer run. One plus proved in each and every release and I have not seen any users complain about it. Using one plus 6 from last couple of months and I Neve felt not a single issue.",One
5,Must read whole review,Zaid Khan,"I have been using this phone from past one month now , what I liked about this phone is the battery life I usually get 5-6 hours of screen on time which is decent , phone looks premium , camera is also good and display is the best part . Things I didn't like is that it heats while playing high graphic games , sound quality from speaker is also a drawback and sometimes I feel sound from earpiece is also less .",
5,Nice quality and best phone ever.,Rajnish,"Nice phone. I'm so happy. Very good camera. It charge fully in only 30 minutes and works for 12hours.Nice speed. Work like a thunder and best for video call. Screen is very large and display is nice. Nice display. Dual SIM. Bigger than iPhone xs max also!  Bought in great Indian sale at rs31,999 only. With dash charger. Nice working. Some apps already downloaded. Meeting emergency button at right side edge. Comes with a cover. The cover is very strong. Large storage unit.",
5,Best in class,Amazon Customer,"Superb performance lasts whole day with games music whatsapp fb and all.will last half a day with heavy games and continous usage but still best in class,camera is fantastic as compared to iphone 8 nd 8 plus gives fight to iphone x as well u wont be able to tell whats d difference,got android pie works like charm with oxygen os in short worth spending 35k on a phone.",One
5,Flagship Killer not anymore.,N_Amazon,Excellent performence of thus phone. This is exactly what they say. I mean the camera is best at this price. Ram management is ok. Battery is good not best in class. And looks is awesome. Glass sandwich design but this is 2018 so it will be like it. I am writing this after 3 months of usage and 6T is already arrived. üòú But happy that not much of a difference between them,
5,"Flagship Killer,Period.",NS,"Amazing phone, I've been using mid range Moto and Sony phones till now and thought of upgrading to a flagship level phone.

5,The best phone under 40000,Rounak Roy,"This is the best phone money can buy under 40000, I got the 8/128 for 35000+1000 cashback during GI Sale. Battery backup is also okay, performance is as expected of a flagship killer. Main point is the camera which creates awesome pictures.",
5,The best in its range,Ramcharan,"It's the best you can find in not just its range but makes the big guys like Samsung and Apple run for money. The charging and the phone speed are the first things that have to be mentioned which are lightning fast. Next comes the oxygen OS which is a paradise for Android users. The display is not top notch but no complaints what so ever. The notch is dealt with perfection. The camera is where it requires improvement, you won't notice any issues in day to day pictures indeed they are amazing. When you push the camera a bit harder you will find minor drawbacks in comparison with the flagships. I am not sure what they did inside the phone but despite being a performance beast the battery doesn't let you down at all. Even if it the battery lets you down, the dash charger is there",

Try to buy it from many days and finally it's on my hand. I don't write the specifications n all.... The lot of taarif already out there. The one thing I just want to say, I go with OP6 even OP6T is available and also with so many offers it is better than OP6T. When I pay the almost same amount though I don't get 3.5 headphones jack, the notch (I like it) nd the fingerprint scanner. Only disappointed is the price....wwwhh if I get some offers, Who get they are lucky.",
5,the speed you need(true),shubham sharma,"everything is perfect in this phone.. this is truely a flagship killer. battery life is great and special feature is dash charging,i love dash charging of one plus you don't have to take stress about the battery just connect it for half an hour and you're good to go. sounds quality is decent. picture quality is awesome,it comes with amoled panel what else do you want in a phone at this rate ( a true flagship killer) or i call it legend killer",One

5,Battery drains like juice and charges faster than lightning!,K Sai Srinivas,"The phone is undoubtedly best in its price range but the only con I found to be annoying is that the battery drains like juice during usage. Just one PUBG game and the battery falls down by almost 20%. So it is annoying during travelling. But luckily the dash charger provided with the phone charges the phone with the same rate as it discharges. You can get upto 25-30% in just 20 minutes. So it is not a problem until we have a plug point to plug in the dash charger. But if you need to charge the phone using some power bank, it takes some considerable time to get charged.....",

The phone justifies the subject of this review but there will always be the people switching from android to iOS, vice-versa rarely happens but according to survey 21% of iOS users have switched to one plus this year which is quite astonishing figure. I don‚Äôt want to stretch out my review now as I myself use iOS device so just one advice there is a higher version of this phone in the market right now so better check that out before purchasing this version.",
5,Would easily recommend buying it!,Akhilesh Gaur,"The price of this phone is great for all the awesomeness it packs in its glass body. First of all, it has a really really premium look and feel due to its glass sandwich design. Then comes the Oxygen OS which gives a very fluid and snappy experience of Android as it is very very close to stock Android with few minor tweaks for improvement. I am in love with this Oxygen OS.",
5,Highly recommend One Plus phones,Shrikant B.,"Best mobile i have ever had, Samsung and iphone are over priced and over rated i used samsung phones all my life and every samsung user know and suffer from battery problem, it drains so quickly but The ONE PLUS 6 is the phone any one can swear on their child's head for the performance and battery life is so long lasting and not self draining just sitting in your pocket this is called a real Smart Phone. Never lags never hangs and best phone for gaming out there.

5,Best Flagship phone for the price range,Amazon Customer,"I have always wanted to own a flagship phone, and OnePlus 6 is my very first flagship.

Overall I am very satisfied with the phone.",
5,Real value for money,Michael Rocha,"At this price point, this is an unbeatable phone. There is very little to fault here. Amazing OS, very fast processing, ample memory and storage, a brilliant camera, excellent display, latest android 9, great community support.

5,You wont regret it!,Rene,"The phone offers a lot for the price. Since you are here, you would already know the pros of the phone. The downside of the phone that you need to keep in mind while making the purchase is about the speaker.  The single firing speaker on the bottom is below par.

5,Trustworthy daily driver,Vichu2190,"Best purchase after a long time. Spectacular mobile truly a beast in all aspect. Great Camera, No lag, cant get any better than Oxygen Os. Only downside was the sound both through the speaker and the jack was just ok. Not sure the sound through the jack can be enhanced through any future software updates fingers crossed. Final conclusion true flagship with no lags nor bloatwares.",
5,The pride of Holding most admired flagship of my generation,Chetan Patil,"One plus 6 is ""The Best flagship"". It's Speed is awesome. I mean it is the fastest phone in market.

4,Gud Mob but not as user friendly as Samsung,J S MALHI,"Good mob with 8 Gb Ram. Value for money high end mob. Looks stunning with Corning glass 5 & red looks.Great speed. Downside:SMSs can't be locked from inadvertent delete, can't move files by select & move but has cut & then go & past in new folder.Not as user friendly as Samsung. Samsung software is way ahead but Ram less of Samsung. Doesn't have SdCard slot which is huge negative point as vital data can't be copied for posterity & incase mob goes bad which Chinese mobs including Oneplus are quite notorious.Last 3 mob of One plus in my family went usesless after 2 to 2.5 yrs with total loss of data.Contacts are visible throughout & can't be hidden. There is no speed dial lkie Samsung. Overall decent mob.",One

4,Powerful phone,Shantanu Kumar,"After deciding among many android phones, i decided to buy One Plus 6 and it was a good decision. Phone has a crisp display and comes with lot of processing power. Loved the front camera, takes sharp pictures. Rear camera is also great however pictures may get blurry when subject is in slight motion. Looking for a good camera app that can help fix this.",One
4,Read this review to know more about OnePlus 6,Ananth,"I moved from redmi note 3 to this phone while thinking I might miss so many features of miui but to my surprise, the oxygen is has almost all the miui features in a more elegant way. Used it for 2 days,I am not a heavy user so easily got 1 day battery life( camera sucks lot of battery though).camera is very good in this price range(front camera is ok ok and edge detection inportrait mode is not perfectly done).Audio experience is not the best but it was louder than my previous phone.Dash charging with type c cable is insanely fast. Already got the Android p update. Call quality is very good. The display is unbelievably good(AMOLED display, gorilla glass 5 on front and back), especially for a budget phone user like me.There are many gestures related to navigation buttons, there is ambient display feature (lift to wake), screen can be calibrated to default/sRGB/DCI-P3/Adaptive mode/ custom color(warm and cool slider), supports double tap to lock and wake up, gestures to open apps, supports parallel apps, 2 4g Sims can be used simultaneously,there is nfc, gaming mode, reading mode, night mode, face unlock, finger print scanner( both can be used simultaneously and both are extremely fast) notch can be hidden, there is customisable LED notification,app lock, otg support, FM radio, sound recorder, no default music player, 3.5mm headphone jack :-), no bloatwares except for 1 OnePlus community app and Google apps, not a big fan of gaming, so haven't tried that....and the list goes on. And of course timely android updates.",One

4,Satisfactory,Abhishek Vashisht,"I bought this phone in July and its about to be 4 months now it is working perfectly. After upgrading to Android Pie, one glitch is there i.e. fingerprint sensor doesn't respond in once when phone is left untouched for a longer time. Rest all is good. Nightscape mode is also there in the latest update. Sound is good. Battery is also good but could have more like 6T. Earlier before Pie, optimisation was too high as most of the apps didn't run in background unless they are opened and kept open in Background (Outlook, Goibibo, MMT, etc) but now that is resolved. Satisfied with the phone overall. But if possible in next update remove that fingerprint issue also.",One

4,A good nice budget phone.,Nishan Brahma,The phone overall is good. Got this phone 8 gb 128gb varient in Rs34999 which was a plus point. The camara quality is just good. The dash charger is the best part of the phone as it charges the phone from 0% to 100% in just more or less than 50 min.,One
4,One plus 6 excellent job,Suvadeep Singh ,"Everything is so good. I'm using a Samsung j5 6 then switch to one plus 6, I'm so impressed by its look because I have the mirror black edition.

In Samsung phone their caller peice is excellent its so loud even at outside. I am so happy with my purchase and thank you to Amazon to for a great deal. My elder brother have one plus 6 too.",One

4,Performance beast at a bargain price,Amazon Customer,OnePlus is a brand now well renowned in India and their latest offering OnePlus 6 is a beast I will divide the section between pros and cons,
4,Worst camera and Sound.,VinayR,"Camera quality is NOT good at all. By seeing unboxing vidoes and reading reviews I had a impression that camera should be good, but since I am using and realised camera is not at all good. Pics don't have clarity. Night photos sucks, it's better not to take photos at all during night times because it is an embracing movement while showing to others üò£",
4,"Fastest Android out there , and doesnt break your bank",Shamant Shetty,"Well being a Samsung S6 edge user for 3 years I was sceptical about the brand initially . But once i got the mobile in hand I knew one thing for sure , this mobile is a beast , the display is pretty good ofcourse not good as Samsung , the camera is pretty good for the price , ofcourse it cant match Google's Pixel or the S9",One

4,A great phone that you can buy in 2018.,Neeraj,Its a great phone given the price.i am pretty much satisfied with the battery and the display. Also has got a nice display. Fast charging is also pretty good. Phone is very snappy with snapdragon 845. Camera is not at par with pixel and iphone but given the price range u won't regret it. Face unlock is the fastest we have in the market. Fingerprint unlock is also very snappy. The only downside is the speaker that is very tiny.,One

Apart from the phone the cashback which has been mentioned while purchasing has not been credited by amazon . Because it has been mentioned that for a particular bank debit or credit card no promo code is required and yet no refund yet .

4,Excellent phone,Manu Sharma,"I was using iPhone for the last six years , spending more than 1 Lac on phone does not make any sense. Finally, made decision to switch to android. I have used Xiaomi also, it also has good phones but Lacks in camera quality. Both Poco F1 and OnePlus 6 are good phones. Using both phones for more than a month and satisfied with both the phones, however touch of OnePlus 6 is slightly better than Poco F1 but front camera of Poco F1 is better. Overall both are good phones but build quality, touch and back camera of oneplus 6 is superior. As of now no regret on switching to android. Since iOS is more secure , so analyzing the security aspects of android.",
4,Nice one..,Prasad Bhase,"Picture quality and sound quality is very good. Look is also awesome. When you purchase this one, you will not think of other mobile. Dash charging one of the plus point. But battery life is not that much good, gets drain quickly. One plus should work on this more to sustain in the market with this price range. Overall experience is good.",
4,"Decent Phone, battery is on the down side",Amit Pandey,"Overall it is a good phone, I am new to Oneplus and felt very much satisfied. Camera is awesome and I never felt any lag in any functionality or app. Only problem is battery, if i use camera for clicking pictures it gets discharge in 4-5 hrs.

4,1 star for Amazon customer care,Amazon Customer,"The phone is absolutely excellent.

I have seen couple of issues too, like print option not available in photo gallery, message app hangs up sometimes (not only for me, my friend also has same problem), etc. Probably, I don't agree to the statements that, One Plus is a Killer phone! Definitely falls in good phone segment.",
4,Good one,ramesh,Camera is yet to be improved. A dual camera must take bright pictures in low light as well. Obviously comparable features with iphone x. But budget makes the huge difference. Ram and Rom at this price are remarkable.,One
4,All i can the best device ever,Amit,"All i can say that its is a budget flagship device. It has all the required features e.g OIS, camera stability, gyroscope, portait mode, professional camera mode, average sound quality, notch, splash resistant, face unlock feature, fingerprint scanner. Battery is very very good.. no heating issue despite running multiple apps symntaneously. Rear camera is best.. howevr front one is not up to mark...processor is best for speedily performance. Design is premium. Just go for it. Best for vloggers.",

4,"Stands by its name, brightness way below par though!",sumit k gupta,"Deducting a star for the brightness of the phone is just ok(which I don't expect, having gone for not best of the premium brands like Samsung etc, having spent so many).",
4,One Plus maintains leadership,Balasubramanian,"One+ has been consistently maintaining its leadership. It does all sections well. I wish they have pure Android version also.  The one problem is that the touch is too sensitive sometimes and the key board layout should be spaced out well. Often while typing fast, there is problem. Particularly the space bar and home button are too close. Otherwise, this phone is great value for money. Premium feeling all the way.",

3,Oneplus 6 Phone Review,Banibrata Mishra,"Picture Quality is Good about not the best, I believe Selfie Camera could have been better ..",One
3,Good phone for the price but not the best at the price as once it used to be.....,Amazon Customer,"Oneplus 6 performs smooth and has decent battery life. Charging speed is one of the fastest out there. Audio via head phone jack sounds really compressed and muddy i'm completely dissappointed with it's performance. Speaker sounds okay and gets reasonably loud. The camera takes some decent pictures but the images look overly processed and has aggressive noise reduction which reduces the detail and sharpness of the pictures. Video recording is good with good stabilisation and the 480 fps slow motion video mode is fun to use but it needs a bit of work as it drops quite a lot of frames and makes the video look jittery even with ample lighting. The display is really good with excellent colours and offers good saturation levels and makes the colours pop. The software is very minimalistic, snappy, fluid and easy to use. The call quality,signal reception and wifi performance are also very good. But now with phones like lg g7 thinq being available at a lower price than the oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t and oneplus ditching the headphone jack for the 6t make it hard to recommend these phones as that lg phone has ip rating, better qhd display, wireless charging and quad dac for better audio performance and a wide angle camera which is rather useful than the useless 20 mp camera of the oneplus 6 and 6t. Overall oneplus 6 is a good phone but not the best in its price range as it used to be from the oneplus 3 to the oneplus 5t. Even the oneplus 6t is also being priced close to 40000 which makes oneplus lose the customers who made the company. Even they are gradually increasing the prices and the features doesn't justify the price increase.",
3,Not like advertisement shows the mobile,UTTAM BAIN,Not like advertisement shows the mobile and camera very poor quality on night or low light shoot as the price tag must be go samsung not Chinese mobile not premium as samsung. So think twice before why this mobile because is build quality not premium as the price tag.,2

3,Oneplus6 Review after 2months usage,Amazon Customer,"Review after 2months usage. Pros- good picture quality, both cameras are excellent, sound is good. Good battery life.Cons - the apps like SBI , ICICI, food Panda taking too much time to open even after upgradation of OS. The second sim slot is not working properly. It will be active with full signal strength only but gives switched off response to other callers and for second slim slot some time OTPs will come very late. Something wrong with second sim slot. No headset will be given with purchase. Other than that very good mobile.",
