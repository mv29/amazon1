5,Best Android Phone,vipul,I have been using Iphone for a very long time. Then I thought of using android phone but was not able to choose a best phone for my self. Then one of my friend suggested me Oneplus. So I purchased Oneplus 3T and I was amazed by its performance. I have been using Oneplus 3T for almost 2 yrs then thought of upgrading to Oneplus 6. This was best decision for me. I have been using it from last 2 months now. Battery life amazing last for one and a half day on 4G. Camera superb. RAM 6GB has never let me down.,4

5,So far best phone ever..,Amazon Customer,"Check the photos I snapped using Oneplus 6 and you can judge it by yourself. Nowadays having depth in photos is very much trending, but the awesome thing which I personally like is the detailing of light the camera captured, never expected such awesome results. it can certainly compete with DSLRs in terms of composition. Apart from this very fast in focusing and capturing the image, that sunrise image I captured on moving vehicle, it's simply awesome.",

5,The affordable flagship with premium build,DEBOJYOTI KUNDU,Thanks Amazon for giving op6 for 27k. This makes it a great deal considering how refined the product feels. Got Android p update soon as the phone has been set up. This phone has very few shortcomings and it feels very premium. Highlight of this phone is definitely oxygen os.

When i bought this, i was  bit sceptical  with regards to the Camera,Display and The Stock android experience. Even though it is not Stock Android, I am Very Comfortable with the UI on ONE PLUS. Moving on, the battery life is Amazing it gives me about 1 Complete day regular usage(Without Gaming), If i switch on the battery saver it gives me roughly more than 1 and half day for my usage. Camera is Good but not that great(as compared to high end devices like samsung s9 or note and even pixel 3xl) and the Display is quite Bright and can been used in daylight. The processor is quite fast with 6gb RAM. One plus 6 is just a premium phone bundled at a Mid Range Price!!!",

5,OnePlus 6 - The Beast iPhone Killer,Neeraj Anchan,"I think OnePlus 6 is by far the best device to ever come out from the OnePlus family. Yes OnePlus 6T will take over but this was a great deal. I have upgraded to the latest Android P and it works wonder on this device. Evrrybody knows the configuration of the device so there is no much to talk about it but what matters is the brand providing you all this at a price range of just 35k. During the sale, the price dropped to 29,999/- but still other devices with the same configuration charge more than 50k so if you are a geek who understands electronics, you will never buy something just for the sake of the brand. Coming to the OnePlus 6 camera, I think it can click some of the most amazing pictures, breathtaking slow motion videos and other smooth videos with the help of inbuilt stabilizer. Dash charger is damn quick. Just more than an hour to charge from 0 - 100%. Being a food blogger and budding filmmaker, camera is my most important feature on this device but also being a complete enthusiast for games, it's Snapdragon 845 delivers to the promise with no lags even on heavy games like PubG and others. I would have loved to see IP68 Certification for water resistance but at this price tag, it's already a more than par device.",One

I was initially pessimistic about the battery backup due to its on-paper capacity, but the practical backup coupled with the dash charging is literally the best. The camera is really precise. I'm not an expert but it's gives really sharp pictures, has lots of options and doesn't get heat up even after extended long periods of video shooting and casual gaming. The speaker is also great(it would be better if they weren't mono speakers though) . Honestly speaking, I moved up from Moto g4 plus to this device so everything feels much superior but it's definitely value for money",One

Design is premium. Just go for it. Best for vloggers.",
4,A great phone that you can buy in 2018.,Neeraj,Its a great phone given the price.i am pretty much satisfied with the battery and the display. Also has got a nice display. Fast charging is also pretty good. Phone is very snappy with snapdragon 845. Camera is not at par with pixel and iphone but given the price range u won't regret it. Face unlock is the fastest we have in the market. Fingerprint unlock is also very snappy. The only downside is the speaker that is very tiny.,One

1,Very Fragile phone,ashish,"I recently had purchased One plus 6 Mobile. Accidentally it fell from my hand and the screen became blank. I took it to the authorized service center and was recommended for replacement of screen which costed me Rs 8100. Within a week of the repair, the mobile again slipped out from my hand and there was a minor crack in its display screen. I have been using Samsung Galaxy S7/ S8 and Motorola phones before this one. There were some falls or cracks in screens if the phone fell from a height, but I never had faced such a problem. Those mobiles are still working despite presence of cracks.",38
1,Received Defective item..,Gagan,I received one plus 6 which is not in good Condition specially Camera. According to me there is manufacturing default. The picture quality is not as compare to other same handsets . I have compared ours with the friend‚Äôs one plus 6 but there is difference b/w our Handset and other. I was supposed to recieve confirmation mail of the replacement yesterday but till now no response or such mail. Realy depressed..,16
1,Not satisfied with this phone,Amazon Customer,I ordered this phone looking at the features and it's picture quality. I've replaced this phone because photos captured are blurr and pixels breaking on stretching. Now again I'm finding the same issue in the new handset which is completely unacceptable and dissatisfying. I'm gonna ask for return as one plus 6 is not standing as per expectation.,16
1,Total loss,Amazon Customer,Now it's not working !!!!!! August 24th...,17

1,Network issue,Yogesh Tiwari,"In other phones, if we are using same network like (Airtel, jio, idea etc) is giving far better speed than OnePlus 6",16
1,Phone DEAD in 9 days,PC,Phone has stopped working just within 9 days  Its frozen dead. The one plus customer support is saying that it could be a hardware defect. I have to give the phone to the service center. Such kind of performance from a so called premium phone is shocking. Do not buy this phone if you value your money,13
1,Apps gets hang,Bagya,My phone as become slow . When compared with other 1plus user's phone my is slow . The apps gets hanged most of the times,16
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND POOR POLICIES.,Ryan,"By all means, the phone is awesome, the camera is perfect for me. I would never replace it for another phone. But the phone I've got died on me TWICE with the last time not opening up until after few hours. I've had the chance to talk raise and escalate this to customer service and they just made me look that I am lying and have not even consider my situation. Been a long time Amazon User and this is the first time I felt cheated on my purchase.",13
